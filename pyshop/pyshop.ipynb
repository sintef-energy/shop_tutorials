    "The SHOP core mostly written in the programming language C. C is one of the most efficient programming languages available, so this is a good match for an optimization model like SHOP. However, C is not very user friendly in the sense that it is not very dynamic, is hard to use and low-level. Python is a programming language that is, in many ways, the complete opposite of C. It is highly dynamic, easy to use and high-level, but also not very efficient. The positive aspects of Python makes it a great candidate for simplifying the interaction with the SHOP core, and it is not detrimental that it is inefficient as long as the heavy computation is still performed by the more efficient C code. These are some of the reasons that motivated the SHOP team to offer the SHOP python API, which essentially is functions written in C that can be called in python. However, because the functions are written C, they are still limited by many of the non-user friendly aspects of C. PyShop was introduced to leverage this.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, PyShop is a \"wrapper\" written in Python to offer a more user-friendly interface for setting up and running SHOP optimizations using python. It is a wrapper in the sense that it offers more high-level functions for handling the lower-level SHOP python API calls for the user. Often, a single PyShop function/action will call multiple SHOP python API functions and at the same time ensure that any input/output data is properly handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical workflow in PyShop starts by creating a ShopSession and defining the optimization time and resolution. Next, the topology is added before time-dependent data is generated or loaded from files or a database. When all data is sent to the SHOP core, commands for optimization are executed before results are extracted."

What really happens in this simple line is that \"model.reservoir\" returns a \"SHOP object type\"-level python object that represents the SHOP object type reservoir. When the method \"add_object\" is called on this python object, it calls the low-level python API call \"shop_api.AddObject(object_type, object_name)\" using the stored SHOP object type and the provided object name. This call itself returns a \"SHOP object\"-level python object, which represents a specific SHOP object hierarchically placed under its \"object type\" in the model structure.
