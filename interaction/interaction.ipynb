    "Proprietary **ASCII** file formats used to be the only way for sending data to the SHOP core and getting results back. After introduction of the SHOP API, several open standards for interacting with the SHOP core have been added. Currently, the **pyshop** python wrapper has gained popularity among users, students and developers. The new **YAML** file format is included as an open standard alternative to the ASCII format. All functionality in SHOP is accessible by any of these three ways of interacting with the core. By accessing the SHOP core through the API, as is done in pyshop and for YAML, all data that is loaded into the SHOP core can also be retrieved and stored."
