The **Data_type** describes how the data for a point of time between the specified two points will be interpreted. If Data_type = 0, the current value is a linear interpolation based on the two points on either side or an extrapolation before or after the end; If Data_type = –1, the current value is set to the value of the nearest previous value (most commonly used).
